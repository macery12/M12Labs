    |
    | Laravel's queue API supports an assortment of back-ends via a single
    | API, giving you convenient access to each back-end using the same
    | syntax for every one. Here you may define a default connection.

    | Long-Running Connection
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | `retry_after` is a property of a *connection*, not of a queue. A single
    | connection therefore has to set it above the longest job it carries, and
    | a modpack install runs for an hour — which is why this used to be 3900
    | for everything, and why a worker killed mid-way through a 60-second job
    | stayed invisible for 65 minutes.
    |
    | So there are two tiers over the same backend. Everything interactive
    | lives on the default connection with a short `retry_after`; only the
    | genuinely long workloads use this one. When the derived connection does
    | not exist (`sync` under test, `sqs` in production) the provider falls
    | back to the default connection, so nothing has to be special-cased.
