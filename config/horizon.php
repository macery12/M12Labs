| adding or resizing a lane ships as a config change, instead of asking every
| operator to hand-edit unit files on upgrade.
|
| Horizon requires a non-clustered Redis queue and the pcntl/posix extensions.
| Everest\Providers\QueueServiceProvider refuses to boot the worker if those
| are missing, rather than letting a supervisor start and quietly process
| nothing. See docs/queues.md.
|
| Job *routing* is not configured here -- Horizon supervises workers, it does
| not decide which queue a job lands on. That map is in config/queue.php.

        | re-run tool calls the user already saw succeed. A turn that fails is
