 *
 * Two halves that are easy to confuse: Horizon supervises worker *processes*
 * (config/horizon.php), while this provider decides which *queue* each job
 * lands on (config/queue.php). Horizon has no opinion about routing.
 *
 * Jobs deliberately do not name their own queue. Note the precedence trap that
 * depends on: Queue::route() is consulted only when the job has no queue of its
 * own, so a job assigning $this->queue in its constructor silently bypasses the
 * map entirely (Illuminate\Support\Traits\ReadsClassAttributes::getAttributeValue).
 * QueueTopologyTest asserts that none do.
