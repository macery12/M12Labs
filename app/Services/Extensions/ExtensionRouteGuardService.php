/**
 * Runtime defense-in-depth for package-contributed route files.
 *
 * The repo-side scanner already rejects `withoutMiddleware()` statically, but
 * a hostile or corrupted package that slipped past review could still strip
 * its inherited admin/client guards at boot. This service re-checks the actual
 * route objects immediately after each package route file is require()'d —
 * which also covers `route:cache`, since the audit runs while the cache is
 * being built and its verdict is baked into the cached routes.
 *
 * A route that fails the audit is dropped: its action is swapped for
 * BlockedExtensionRouteController (a plain 404) while its middleware stack is
 * restored, and the violation is reported loudly via report(). The rest of the
 * panel — and the extension's compliant routes — keep working.
