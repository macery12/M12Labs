/**
 * These are the first destructive endpoints on the queue page, and the three
 * queue capabilities are deliberately not interchangeable: reading the failed
 * list, re-running the work, and destroying the only copy of a payload are
 * three different kinds of authority.
 *
 * The resolver test proves every route *declares* a permission. This proves the
 * declaration is the right one, over HTTP, with a key holding exactly one of
 * them -- which is the thing a reader of the route file cannot check.
 *
 * One refused request per test, deliberately. The panel's exception handler
 * calls `rollBack(0)` when it renders, which unwinds the transaction this suite
 * runs inside: after a request that throws, the fixtures are gone -- rows, the
 * access profile and the API key with them -- and everything after it in the
 * same test would be answered 401 for reasons that have nothing to do with what
 * was being tested. Hence the data providers.
