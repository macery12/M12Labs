 * The queue page shows an operator why a job failed, and a failure carries its
 * secrets in two places. The payload is the obvious one. The exception is the
 * one that catches people out: Laravel interpolates a query's bindings into the
 * QueryException message, so a failed write stores its column values verbatim.
 *
 * Nothing here configures a privacy setting, and that absence is the
 * assertion rather than an omission: redaction on this page used to run its
 * fuzzy pass only while the AI module's switch was on, so an admin page got
 * more revealing because somebody changed a setting in a different module.
 * The engine is core's now and takes its categories as an argument, so both
 * passes run whatever any extension is configured to do -- or whether one is
 * installed at all.
